RButton + Drag::		This is the most powerful feature of NiftyWindows. The area of every window is tiled in a virtual 9-cell grid with three columns and rows. The center cell is the largest one and you can grab and move a window around by clicking and holding it with the right mouse button. The other eight corner cells are used to resize a resizable window in the same manner.
RButton + LButton::		Minimizes the selected window (if minimizable) to the task bar. If you press the left button over the titlebar the selected window will be rolled up  instead of being minimized. You have to apply this action again to roll the window back down.
RButton + MButton::		Closes the selected window (if closeable) as if you click the close button in the titlebar. If you press the middle button over the titlebar the selected window will be sent to the bottom of the window stack instead of being closed.
